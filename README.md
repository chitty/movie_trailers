# P1: Movie Trailer Website

This project was developed for the course [Programming Foundations with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036).

It creates a website with my favorite movies. The website shows the rating for each movie according to [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/), and the user can watch the trailer for each movie.

## Running the project

Simply run:

	python entertaiment_center.py

This runs thanks to the [base code provided](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode), which was slightly modified to display all the attributes of each movie object.
